I put this article to demonstrate how you can write blog posts/articles using AstroPaper theme.\n\nMy experience about developing my first portfolio website and a blog using NextJS and a headless CMS.\n\n![Building portfolio](https://satnaing.dev/_ipx/w_2048,q_75/https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fnoezectz%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1653050141%2FSatNaing%2Fblog_at_cafe_ei1wf4.jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fnoezectz%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1653050141%2FSatNaing%2Fblog_at_cafe_ei1wf4.jpg&w=2048&q=75)\n\n## Motivation\n\nI've been always thinking about launching my own website with my custom domain name (**satnaing.dev**) since my college student life. But that never happened until this project. I've done several projects and works about web application development but I didn't make an effort to do this.\n\nSo, \"what about blog?\" you may ask. Yeah, blog also has been in my project list for some time. I always wanted to make a blog project using some of the latest technologies. However, I've been busy with my works and other projects so that blog project has never been started.\n\nIn these days, I tend to develop my own projects with the focus in good quality rather than quantity. After the project is done, I usually put a proper readme file in the Github repo. But Github repo readme is only suitable for technical aspects (this is just my thought). I want to write down my experiences and challenges. Thus, I decided to make my own blog. Plus, at this point, I have decent experiences and confidence to develop this project.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\nFor the front-end, I wanted to use [React](https://reactjs.org/ \"React Official Website\"). But React alone is not good enough for SEO; and I did have to consider many factors like routing, image optimization etc. So, I chose [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/ \"NextJS Official Website\") as my main front-end stack. And of course TypeScript for type checking. (It's said that you'll love TypeScript when you're used to it 😉)\n\nFor styling, I use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/ \"Tailwind CSS Official Website\"). This is because I love developer experience that Tailwind gives and it has a lot of flexibilities compared to other component UI libraries like MUI or React Bootstrap.\n\nAll contents of this project reside within the GitHub repository. All my blog posts (including this one) are written in Markdown file format since I'm very used to with this. But to write Markdown along with its frontmatter effortlessly, I use [Forestry](https://forestry.io/ \"Forestry Official Website\") headless CMS. It is a git-based CMS that can serve Markdown and other contents. Because of this, I can write my contents either using Markdown or wysiwyg editor. Besides, writing frontmatters with this is a breeze.\n\nImages and assets are uploaded and stored in [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/ \"Cloudinary Official Website\"). I connect Cloudinary via Forestry and manage them directly in the dashboard.\n\nIn conclusion, these are the tech stack I've used for this project.\n\n- Front-end: NextJS (TypeScript)\n- Styling: TailwindCSS\n- Animations: GSAP\n- CMS: Forestry Headless CMS\n- Deployment: Vercel\n\n## Features\n\nThe following are certain features of my portfolio and blog\n\n### SEO Friendly\n\nThe entire project is developed with SEO focus in mind. I've used proper meta tags, descriptions and heading alignments. This website is now indexed by Google.\n\n> You can search this website on google by using keywords like 'sat naing dev'\n\n![searching satnaing.dev on google](https://res.cloudinary.com/noezectz/image/upload/v1648231400/SatNaing/satnaing-on-google_asflq6.png \"satnaing.dev is indexed\")\n\nMoreover, this website will be displayed well when shared to social media due to properly used meta tags.\n\n![satnaing.dev card layout when shared to Facebook](https://res.cloudinary.com/noezectz/image/upload/v1653106955/SatNaing/satnaing-dev-share-on-facebook_1_zjoehx.png \"Card layout when shared to Facebook\")\n\n### Dynamic Sitemap\n\nSitemap plays an important part in SEO. Because of this, every single page of this site should be included in sitemap.xml. I made an auto generated sitemap in my website whenever I create a new content or tags or categories.\n\n### Light & Dark Themes\n\nDue to dark theme trend in recent years, many websites include dark theme out of the box nowadays. Certainly, my website also supports light & dark themes.\n\n### Fully Accessible\n\nThis website is fully accessible. You can navigate around by only using keyboard. I put all a11y enhancement best practices like including alt text in all images, no skipping headings, using semantic HTML tags, using aria-attributes properly.\n\n### Search box, Categories & Tags\n\nAll blog contents can be searched by search box. Moreover, contents can be filtered by categories and tags. In this way, blog readers can search and read what they really want.\n\n### Performance and Lighthouse Score\n\nThis website got very good performance and lighthouse score thanks to proper development and best practices. Here's the lighthouse score for this website.\n\n![satnaing.dev Lighthouse score](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53733092/159957822-7082e459-11e9-4616-8f1e-49d0881f7cbb.png \"satnaing.dev Lighthouse score\")\n\n### Animations\n\nInitially I used [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/ \"Framer Motion\") to add animations and micro interactions for this website. However, when I tried to use some complex animations and parallax effects, I found it inconvenient to integrate with Framer Motion (Maybe I'm not very good at and used to working with it). Hence, I decided to use [GSAP](https://greensock.com/ \"GSAP Animation Library\") for all of my animations. It is one of the most popular animation library and it is capable of doing complex and advanced animations. You can see animations and micro interactions on pretty much every page of this website.\n\n![animations at satnaing.dev](https://res.cloudinary.com/noezectz/image/upload/v1653108324/SatNaing/ezgif.com-gif-maker_2_hehtlm.gif \"satnaing.dev website\")\n\n## Outro\n\nIn conclusion, this project gives me a lot of experience and confidence about developing blog site (SSG). Now, I have gained knowledge of git-based CMS and how it interacts with NextJS. I've also learned about SEO, dynamic sitemap generation and indexing Google procedures. I will make better projects in the future. So, stay tuned! ✌🏻\n\nAnd... last but not least, I would like to say 'thanks' to my friend [Swann Fevian Kyaw](https://www.facebook.com/bon.zai.3910 \"Swann Fevian Kyaw's Facebook Account\") (@[ToonHa](https://www.facebook.com/ToonHa-102639465752883 \"ToonHa Facebook Page\")) who has drawn a beautiful illustration for my hero section of the website.\n\n## Project Links\n\n- Website: [https://satnaing.dev/](https://satnaing.dev/ \"https://satnaing.dev/\")\n- Blog: [https://satnaing.dev/blog](https://satnaing.dev/blog \"https://satnaing.dev/blog\")\n- Repo: [https://github.com/satnaing/my-portfolio](https://github.com/satnaing/my-portfolio \"https://github.com/satnaing/my-portfolio\")","src/content/blog/portfolio-website-development.md","484bfa154b6115b2",{"html":54,"metadata":55},"\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>This article is originally from my \u003Ca href=\"https://satnaing.dev/blog/posts/how-do-i-develop-my-portfolio-and-blog\">blog post\u003C/a>.

Includes features like autocomplete, multiple themes, command hints etc.\n\n![Sat Naing's Terminal Portfolio](https://satnaing.dev/_ipx/w_2048,q_75/https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fnoezectz%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1654754125%2FSatNaing%2Fterminal-screenshot_gu3kkc.png?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fnoezectz%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1654754125%2FSatNaing%2Fterminal-screenshot_gu3kkc.png&w=2048&q=75)\n\n## Table of contents\n\n## Intro\n\nRecently, I've developed and published my portfolio + a blog. I’m glad I got some good feedback for it. Today, I want to introduce my new terminal-like portfolio website. It is developed using ReactJS, TypeScript. I got this idea from CodePen and YouTube.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\nThis project is a frontend project without any backend codes. The UI/UX part is designed in Figma. For the frontend user-interface, I chose React over pain JavaScript and NextJS. Why?\n\n- Firstly, I want to write declarative code. Managing HTML DOM using JavaScript imperatively is really tedious.\n- Secondly, because it is React!!! It is fast, and reliable.\n- Lastly, I don’t need much of the SEO features, routing and image optimization provided by NextJS.\n\nAnd of course there's TypeScript for type checking.\n\nFor styling, I took a different approach than what I usually do. Instead of choosing Pure CSS, Sass, or Utility CSS Framework like TailwindCSS, I chose the CSS-in-JS way (Styled-Components). Although I’ve known about Styled-Components for some time, I’ve never tried it out. So, the writing style and structures of Styled-Components in this project may not be very organized or very good.\n\nThis project doesn’t need very complex state management. I just use ContextAPI in this project for multiple theming and to avoid prop drilling.\n\nHere’s a quick recap for the tech stack.\n\n- Frontend: [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/ \"React Website\"), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/ \"TypeScript Website\")\n- Styling: [Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com/ \"Styled-Components Website\")\n- UI/UX: [Figma](https://figma.com/ \"Figma Website\")\n- State Management: [ContextAPI](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html \"React ContextAPI\")\n- Deployment: [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/ \"Netlify Website\")\n\n## Features\n\nHere are some features of the project.\n\n### Multiple Themes\n\nUsers can change multiple themes.

Typography Plugin",[112,217],"Astro","EXAMPLE POST: About Tailwind Typography Plugin and how you can use it effectively.","> This article is from [TailwindLabs](https://tailwindcss-typography.vercel.app/). I put this article to demonstrate how you can write blog posts/articles using AstroPaper theme.\n\nBy default, Tailwind removes all of the default browser styling from paragraphs, headings, lists and more. This ends up being really useful for building application UIs because you spend less time undoing user-agent styles, but when you _really are_ just trying to style some content that came from a rich-text editor in a CMS or a markdown file, it can be surprising and unintuitive.\n\nWe get lots of complaints about it actually, with people regularly asking us things like:\n\n> Why is Tailwind removing the default styles on my `h1` elements? How do I disable this? What do you mean I lose all the other base styles too?\n> We hear you, but we're not convinced that simply disabling our base styles is what you really want. You don't want to have to remove annoying margins every time you use a `p` element in a piece of your dashboard UI. And I doubt you really want your blog posts to use the user-agent styles either — you want them to look _awesome_, not awful.\n\nThe `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin is our attempt to give you what you _actually_ want, without any of the downsides of doing something stupid like disabling our base styles.\n\nIt adds a new `prose` class that you can slap on any block of vanilla HTML content and turn it into a beautiful, well-formatted document:\n\n```html\n\u003Carticle class=\"prose\">\n  \u003Ch1>Garlic bread with cheese: What the science tells us\u003C/h1>\n  \u003Cp>\n    For years parents have espoused the health benefits of eating garlic bread\n    with cheese to their children, with the food earning such an iconic status\n    in our culture that kids will often dress up as warm, cheesy loaf for\n    Halloween.\n  \u003C/p>\n  \u003Cp>\n    But a recent study shows that the celebrated appetizer may be linked to a\n    series of rabies cases springing up around the country.\n  \u003C/p>\n  \u003C!-- ... -->\n\u003C/article>\n```\n\nFor more information about how to use the plugin and the features it includes, [read the documentation](https://github.com/tailwindcss/typography/blob/master/README.md).\n\n---\n\n## What to expect from here on out\n\nWhat follows from here is just a bunch of absolute nonsense I've written to dogfood the plugin itself. It includes every sensible typographic element I could think of, like **bold text**, unordered lists, ordered lists, code blocks, block quotes, _and even italics_.\n\nIt's important to cover all of these use cases for a few reasons:\n\n1. We want everything to look good out of the box.\n2. Really just the first reason, that's the whole point of the plugin.\n3. Here's a third pretend reason though a list with three items looks more realistic than a list with two items.\n\nNow we're going to try out another header style.\n\n### Typography should be easy\n\nSo that's a header for you — with any luck if we've done our job correctly that will look pretty reasonable.\n\nSomething a wise person once told me about typography is:\n\n> Typography is pretty important if you don't want your stuff to look like trash. Make it good then it won't be bad.\n> It's probably important that images look okay here by default as well:\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cimg\n    src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1556740758-90de374c12ad?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1000&q=80\"\n    alt=\"\"\n  />\n  \u003Cfigcaption>\n    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of\n    classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.\n  \u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nNow I'm going to show you an example of an unordered list to make sure that looks good, too:\n\n- So here is the first item in this list.\n- In this example we're keeping the items short.\n- Later, we'll use longer, more complex list items.\n\nAnd that's the end of this section.\n\n## What if we stack headings?\n\n### We should make sure that looks good, too.\n\nSometimes you have headings directly underneath each other. In those cases you often have to undo the top margin on the second heading because it usually looks better for the headings to be closer together than a paragraph followed by a heading should be.\n\n### When a heading comes after a paragraph …\n\nWhen a heading comes after a paragraph, we need a bit more space, like I already mentioned above. Now let's see what a more complex list would look like.\n\n- **I often do this thing where list items have headings.**\n\n  For some reason I think this looks cool which is unfortunate because it's pretty annoying to get the styles right.\n\n  I often have two or three paragraphs in these list items, too, so the hard part is getting the spacing between the paragraphs, list item heading, and separate list items to all make sense. Pretty tough honestly, you could make a strong argument that you just shouldn't write this way.\n\n- **Since this is a list, I need at least two items.**\n\n  I explained what I'm doing already in the previous list item, but a list wouldn't be a list if it only had one item, and we really want this to look realistic. That's why I've added this second list item so I actually have something to look at when writing the styles.\n\n- **It's not a bad idea to add a third item either.**\n\n  I think it probably would've been fine to just use two items but three is definitely not worse, and since I seem to be having no trouble making up arbitrary things to type, I might as well include it.\n\nAfter this sort of list I usually have a closing statement or paragraph, because it kinda looks weird jumping right to a heading.\n\n## Code should look okay by default.\n\nI think most people are going to use [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) or [Prism](https://prismjs.com/) or something if they want to style their code blocks but it wouldn't hurt to make them look _okay_ out of the box, even with no syntax highlighting.\n\nHere's what a default `tailwind.config.js` file looks like at the time of writing:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  purge: [],\n  theme: {\n    extend: {},\n  },\n  variants: {},\n  plugins: [],\n};\n```\n\nHopefully that looks good enough to you.\n\n### What about nested lists?\n\nNested lists basically always look bad which is why editors like Medium don't even let you do it, but I guess since some of you goofballs are going to do it we have to carry the burden of at least making it work.\n\n1. **Nested lists are rarely a good idea.**\n   - You might feel like you are being really \"organized\" or something but you are just creating a gross shape on the screen that is hard to read.\n   - Nested navigation in UIs is a bad idea too, keep things as flat as possible.\n   - Nesting tons of folders in your source code is also not helpful.\n2. **Since we need to have more items, here's another one.**\n   - I'm not sure if we'll bother styling more than two levels deep.\n   - Two is already too much, three is guaranteed to be a bad idea.\n   - If you nest four levels deep you belong in prison.\n3. **Two items isn't really a list, three is good though.**\n   - Again please don't nest lists if you want people to actually read your content.\n   - Nobody wants to look at this.\n   - I'm upset that we even have to bother styling this.\n\nThe most annoying thing about lists in Markdown is that `\u003Cli>` elements aren't given a child `\u003Cp>` tag unless there are multiple paragraphs in the list item. That means I have to worry about styling that annoying situation too.\n\n- **For example, here's another nested list.**\n\n  But this time with a second paragraph.\n\n  - These list items won't have `\u003Cp>` tags\n  - Because they are only one line each\n\n- **But in this second top-level list item, they will.**\n\n  This is especially annoying because of the spacing on this paragraph.\n\n  - As you can see here, because I've added a second line, this list item now has a `\u003Cp>` tag.\n\n    This is the second line I'm talking about by the way.\n\n  - Finally here's another list item so it's more like a list.\n\n- A closing list item, but with no nested list, because why not?\n\nAnd finally a sentence to close off this section.\n\n## There are other elements we need to style\n\nI almost forgot to mention links, like [this link to the Tailwind CSS website](https://tailwindcss.com). We almost made them blue but that's so yesterday, so we went with dark gray, feels edgier.\n\nWe even included table styles, check it out:\n\n| Wrestler                | Origin       | Finisher           |\n| ----------------------- | ------------ | ------------------ |\n| Bret \"The Hitman\" Hart  | Calgary, AB  | Sharpshooter       |\n| Stone Cold Steve Austin | Austin, TX   | Stone Cold Stunner |\n| Randy Savage            | Sarasota, FL | Elbow Drop         |\n| Vader                   | Boulder, CO  | Vader Bomb         |\n| Razor Ramon             | Chuluota, FL | Razor's Edge       |\n\nWe also need to make sure inline code looks good, like if I wanted to talk about `\u003Cspan>` elements or tell you the good news about `@tailwindcss/typography`.\n\n### Sometimes I even use `code` in headings\n\nEven though it's probably a bad idea, and historically I've had a hard time making it look good. This _\"wrap the code blocks in backticks\"_ trick works pretty well though really.\n\nAnother thing I've done in the past is put a `code` tag inside of a link, like if I wanted to tell you about the [`tailwindcss/docs`](https://github.com/tailwindcss/docs) repository. I don't love that there is an underline below the backticks but it is absolutely not worth the madness it would require to avoid it.\n\n#### We haven't used an `h4` yet\n\nBut now we have. Please don't use `h5` or `h6` in your content, Medium only supports two heading levels for a reason, you animals. I honestly considered using a `before` pseudo-element to scream at you if you use an `h5` or `h6`.\n\nWe don't style them at all out of the box because `h4` elements are already so small that they are the same size as the body copy. What are we supposed to do with an `h5`, make it _smaller_ than the body copy? No thanks.\n\n### We still need to think about stacked headings though.\n\n#### Let's make sure we don't screw that up with `h4` elements, either.\n\nPhew, with any luck we have styled the headings above this text and they look pretty good.\n\nLet's add a closing paragraph here so things end with a decently sized block of text. I can't explain why I want things to end that way but I have to assume it's because I think things will look weird or unbalanced if there is a heading too close to the end of the document.\n\nWhat I've written here is probably long enough, but adding this final sentence can't hurt.","src/content/blog/tailwind-typography.md","cddf47764555901e",{"html":223,"metadata":224},"\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>This article is from \u003Ca href=\"https://tailwindcss-typography.vercel.app/\">TailwindLabs\u003C/a>.

Their biggest flaw is that client-side hooks are per machine.\n\nYou can get around this by having a `hooks` directory and manually copy them to the `.git/hooks` directory or set up a symlink, but this all requires you to remember to set it up, and that is not something I am good at doing.\n\nAs this project uses npm, we are able to make use of a package called [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) (this is already installed in AstroPaper) to automatically install the hooks for us.\n\n## The Hook\n\nAs we want this hook to run as we commit the code to update the dates and then have that as part of our change we are going to use the `pre-commit` hook. This has already been set up by this AstroPaper project, but if it hadn't, you would run `npx husky add .husky/pre-commit 'echo \"This is our new pre-commit hook\"'`.\n\nNavigating to the `hooks/pre-commit` file, we are going to add one or both of the following snippets.\n\n### Updating the modified date when a file is edited\n\n---\n\nUPDATE:\n\nThis section has been updated with a new version of the hook that is smarter. It will now not increment the `modDatetime` until the post is published. On the first publish, set the draft status to `first` and watch the magic happen.\n\n---\n\n```shell\n# Modified files, update the modDatetime\ngit diff --cached --name-status |\ngrep -i '^M.*\\.md$' |\nwhile read _ file; do\n  filecontent=$(cat \"$file\")\n  frontmatter=$(echo \"$filecontent\" | awk -v RS='---' 'NR==2{print}')\n  draft=$(echo \"$frontmatter\" | awk '/^draft: /{print $2}')\n  if [ \"$draft\" = \"false\" ]; then\n    echo \"$file modDateTime updated\"\n    cat $file | sed \"/---.*/,/---.*/s/^modDatetime:.*$/modDatetime: $(date -u \"+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\")/\" > tmp\n    mv tmp $file\n    git add $file\n  fi\n  if [ \"$draft\" = \"first\" ]; then\n    echo \"First release of $file, draft set to false and modDateTime removed\"\n    cat $file | sed \"/---.*/,/---.*/s/^modDatetime:.*$/modDatetime:/\" | sed \"/---.*/,/---.*/s/^draft:.*$/draft: false/\" > tmp\n    mv tmp $file\n    git add $file\n  fi\ndone\n```\n\n`git diff --cached --name-status` gets the files from git that have been staged for committing. The output looks like:\n\n```shell\nA       src/content/blog/setting-dates-via-git-hooks.md\n```\n\nThe letter at the start denotes what action has been taken, in the above example the file has been added. Modified files have `M`\n\nWe pipe that output into the grep command where we are looking at each line to find that have been modified. The line needs to start with `M` (`^(M)`), have any number of characters after that (`.*`) and end with the `.md` file extension (`.(md)$`).This is going to filter out the lines that are not modified markdown files `egrep -i \"^(M).*\\.(md)$\"`.\n\n---\n\n#### Improvement - More Explicit\n\nThis could be added to only look for files that we markdown files in the `blog` directory, as these are the only ones that will have the right frontmatter\n\n---\n\nThe regex will capture the two parts, the letter and the file path. We are going to pipe this list into a while loop to iterate over the matching lines and assign the letter to `a` and the path to `b`. We are going to ignore `a` for now.\n\nTo know the draft staus of the file, we need its frontmatter. In the following code we are using `cat` to get the content of the file, then using `awk` to split the file on the frontmatter separator (`---`) and taking the second block (the fonmtmatter, the bit between the `---`). From here we are using `awk` again to find the draft key and print is value.\n\n```shell\n  filecontent=$(cat \"$file\")\n  frontmatter=$(echo \"$filecontent\" | awk -v RS='---' 'NR==2{print}')\n  draft=$(echo \"$frontmatter\" | awk '/^draft: /{print $2}')\n```\n\nNow we have the value for `draft` we are going to do 1 of 3 things, set the modDatetime to now (when draft is false `if [ \"$draft\" = \"false\" ]; then`), clear the modDatetime and set draft to false (when draft is set to first `if [ \"$draft\" = \"first\" ]; then`), or nothing (in any other case).\n\nThe next part with the sed command is a bit magical to me as I don't often use it, it was copied from [another blog post on doing something similar](https://mademistakes.com/notes/adding-last-modified-timestamps-with-git/). In essence, it is looking inside the frontmatter tags (`---`) of the file to find the `pubDatetime:` key, getting the full line and replacing it with the `pubDatetime: $(date -u \"+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\")/\"` same key again and the current datetime formatted correctly.\n\nThis replacement is in the context of the whole file so we put that into a temporary file (`> tmp`), then we move (`mv`) the new file into the location of the old file, overwriting it. This is then added to git ready to be committed as if we made the change ourselves.\n\n---\n\n#### NOTE\n\nFor the `sed` to work the frontmatter needs to already have the `modDatetime` key in the frontmatter. There are some other changes you will need to make for the app to build with a blank date, see [further down](#empty-moddatetime-changes)\n\n---\n\n### Adding the Date for new files\n\nAdding the date for a new file is the same process as above, but this time we are looking for lines that have been added (`A`) and we are going to replace the `pubDatetime` value.\n\n```shell\n# New files, add/update the pubDatetime\ngit diff --cached --name-status | egrep -i \"^(A).*\\.(md)$\" | while read a b; do\n  cat $b | sed \"/---.*/,/---.*/s/^pubDatetime:.*$/pubDatetime: $(date -u \"+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\")/\" > tmp\n  mv tmp $b\n  git add $b\ndone\n```\n\n---\n\n#### Improvement - Only Loop Once\n\nWe could use the `a` variable to switch inside the loop and either update the `modDatetime` or add the `pubDatetime` in one loop.\n\n---\n\n## Populating the frontmatter\n\nIf your IDE supports snippets then there is the option to create a custom snippet to populate the frontmatter.[In AstroPaper v4 will come with one for VSCode by default.](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper/pull/206)\n\n\u003Cvideo autoplay muted=\"muted\" controls plays-inline=\"true\" class=\"border border-skin-line\">\n  \u003Csource src=\"https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper/assets/17761689/e13babbc-2d78-405d-8758-ca31915e41b0\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n\u003C/video>\n\n## Empty `modDatetime` changes\n\nTo allow Astro to compile the markdown and do its thing, it needs to know what is expected in the frontmatter. It does this via the config in `src/content/config.ts`\n\nTo allow the key to be there with no value we need to edit line 10 to add the `.nullable()` function.\n\n```typescript\nconst blog = defineCollection({\n  type: \"content\",\n  schema: ({ image }) =>\n    z.object({\n      author: z.string().default(SITE.author),\n      pubDatetime: z.date(),\n-     modDatetime: z.date().optional(),\n+     modDatetime: z.date().optional().nullable(),\n      title: z.string(),\n      featured: z.boolean().optional(),\n      draft: z.boolean().optional(),\n      tags: z.array(z.string()).default([\"others\"]),\n      ogImage: image()\n        .refine(img => img.width >= 1200 && img.height >= 630, {\n          message: \"OpenGraph image must be at least 1200 X 630 pixels!\",\n        })\n        .or(z.string())\n        .optional(),\n      description: z.string(),\n      canonicalURL: z.string().optional(),\n      readingTime: z.string().optional(),\n    }),\n});\n```\n\nTo stop the IDE complaining in the blog engine files I have also done the following:\n\n1. added `| null` to line 15 in `src/layouts/Layout.astro` so that it looks like\n\n```typescript\nexport interface Props {\n  title?: string;\n  author?: string;\n  description?: string;\n  ogImage?: string;\n  canonicalURL?: string;\n  pubDatetime?: Date;\n  modDatetime?: Date | null;\n}\n```\n\n\u003C!-- This needs to be 2 as it doesn't pick it up with the code block -->\n\n2. added `| null` to line 5 in `src/components/Datetime.tsx` so that it looks like\n\n```typescript\ninterface DatetimesProps {\n  pubDatetime: string | Date;\n  modDatetime: string | Date | undefined | null;\n}\n```","src/content/blog/setting-dates-via-git-hooks.md","41da1cafbe9973ee",{"html":286,"metadata":287},"\u003Cp>In this post I will explain how to use the pre-commit Git hook to automate the input of the created (\u003Ccode>pubDatetime\u003C/code>) and modified (\u003Ccode>modDatetime\u003C/code>) in the AstroPaper blog theme frontmatter\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"table-of-contents\">Table of contents\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>\u003C/p>\u003Cdetails>\u003Csummary>Open Table of contents\u003C/summary>\u003Cp>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#have-them-everywhere\">Have them Everywhere\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#the-hook\">The Hook\u003C/a>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#updating-the-modified-date-when-a-file-is-edited\">Updating the modified date when a file is edited\u003C/a>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#improvement---more-explicit\">Improvement - More Explicit\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#note\">NOTE\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#adding-the-date-for-new-files\">Adding the Date for new files\u003C/a>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#improvement---only-loop-once\">Improvement - Only Loop Once\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#populating-the-frontmatter\">Populating the frontmatter\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#empty-moddatetime-changes\">Empty \u003Ccode>modDatetime\u003C/code> changes\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>\u003C/p>\u003C/details>\u003Cp>\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"have-them-everywhere\">Have them Everywhere\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks\">Git hooks\u003C/a> are great for automating tasks like \u003Ca href=\"https://gist.github.com/SSmale/3b380e5bbed3233159fb7031451726ea\">adding\u003C/a> or \u003Ca href=\"https://itnext.io/using-git-hooks-to-enforce-branch-naming-policy-ffd81fa01e5e\">checking\u003C/a> the branch name to your commit messages or \u003Ca href=\"https://gist.github.com/SSmale/367deee757a9b2e119d241e120249000\">stopping you committing plain text secrets\u003C/a>.
