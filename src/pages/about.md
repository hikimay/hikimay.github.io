### Research Interests

Currently, I am primarily interested in the intersection of machine learning and mathematical optimization, with specific interests in 1) inverse optimization in the presence of contextual information, 2) hypersurface optimization methods for representing Pareto sets/fronts in multi-objective optimization problems, and 3) sequential decision-making under uncertainty and online learning.
